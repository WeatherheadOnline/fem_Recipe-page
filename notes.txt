~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The challenge is to recreate a recipe card in a responsive, well-spaced format.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

** Process: **

Added colors to css as variables
Added CSS rules for text preset classes
Added @font-face rules to facilitate use of hosted fonts

Decided that layout would be another straightforward collection of nested containers -> have some fun with the construction by using React.
- construct ordered or unordered lists from arrays of ingredient or instruction items

*** add some SASS such that <li> inherits from .text-preset-whatever, and <li> > <span> inherits from .text-preset-whatever-else. ***
